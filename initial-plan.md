# AI Development Workflow Platform

## Project Overview
A collaborative AI-powered development workflow platform that automates and streamlines software development tasks through intelligent agents.

## System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Frontend Kanban Board**
   - User interface for task management
   - Drag-and-drop task movement
   - Real-time state tracking
   - Agent interaction visualization

2. **Task Management System**
   - Ticket creation and tracking
   - State machine for workflow progression
   - Metadata storage for task context

3. **Agent Orchestration Layer**
   - Code Planning Agent
   - Code Generation Agent
   - Code Review Agent
   - Human-in-the-loop Integration

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Task Initialization
- User creates ticket on Kanban board
- Ticket enters "Todo" column
- System assigns unique identifier

### 2. Code Planning Phase
- Planning agent breaks down ticket into granular steps
- Generates detailed implementation strategy
- Updates ticket with implementation plan
- Moves ticket to "Ready to Code" column

### 3. Code Generation
- Generation agent interprets planning details
- Produces implementation code
- Adds generated code as ticket comment
- Moves ticket to "Code Review" column

### 4. Code Review
- Review agent analyzes generated code
- Identifies potential improvements
- Suggests specific code modifications
- Triggers human review if significant changes detected

### 5. Human Intervention
- Human reviewer evaluates suggested changes
- Approves or requests further modifications
- Can terminate or restart workflow cycle

## Workflow Constraints
- Maximum 3 planning/generation cycles
- Human can interrupt/terminate at any stage
- Strict state transition rules

## Technology Stack Recommendations
- Frontend: React/Next.js
- Backend: Node.js/Express
- Database: MongoDB/PostgreSQL
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Authentication: OAuth/JWT

## API Endpoints
- `/tasks/create`
- `/tasks/{id}/plan`
- `/tasks/{id}/generate`
- `/tasks/{id}/review`
- `/tasks/{id}/approve`

## Security Considerations
- Role-based access control
- Input validation
- Secure API authentication
- Audit logging for all agent actions

## Scalability Approach
- Microservices architecture
- Containerization (Docker)
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Message queue for agent communication

## Monitoring & Observability
- Comprehensive logging
- Performance metrics tracking
- Error tracking and alerting
- Agent performance dashboards

## Future Enhancements
- Machine learning model for agent performance optimization
- Advanced natural language processing
- Integration with version control systems
- Predictive task complexity estimation

## Estimated Development Timeline
- Phase 1 (4 weeks): Core architecture and initial agent implementations
- Phase 2 (3 weeks): Frontend development and integration
- Phase 3 (2 weeks): Testing and refinement

## Proof of Concept Success Criteria
- 80% task automation rate
- Consistent code quality maintenance
- Reduced human intervention overhead
- Smooth state transitions
